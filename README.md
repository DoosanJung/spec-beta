Investors' disagreement and the risk-return trade-off in the Korea stock market

### Motivation
[Hong and Sraer (2016)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jofi.12431/abstract) <sup name = "footnote3">[3](#footnote3)</sup> shows that with short-sales constraints,
> The greater divergence of opinion creates overpricing of high beta stocks compared to low beta ones [Miller (1977)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2326520?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) <sup name = "footnote1">[1](#footnote1)</sup> and [Chen et al. (2002)](https://scholar.harvard.edu/stein/publications/breadth-ownership-and-stock-returns)<sup name = "footnote2">[2](#footnote2)</sup> . Arbitrageurs attempt to correct this mispricing but their limited risk-bearing capacity results only in limited shorting leading to equilibrium overpricing.


### Data
1. Sample period : 2009-01-01 ~ 2017.09.30
2. Sample stocks : Korea Stock Market ([KOSPI market](http://global.krx.co.kr/contents/GLB/02/0201/0201010100/GLB0201010100.jsp))
3. Data source : [DataGuide](http://www.dataguide.co.kr/DG5web/eng/index.asp)
and [Korean Statistical Information Service](http://kosis.kr/eng/)


### Beta-sorted portfolios

1. **Pre-ranking betas**<br> Each month, estimate the market beta of each stock by regressing the past twelve months of daily *excess stock return* on *excess market return*.
<br>
The regressor variable (market return) is constructed by the contemporaneous excess market return and five lags of the contemporaneous excess market returns to account for the illiquidity of small stocks.
<br>
Pre-ranking beta is the sum of six ordinary least squares (OLS) coefficients.

2. **20 beta-sorted portfolios** <br> Sort and assign stocks every month into twenty (20) beta-sorted portfolios. Then, calculate both equal-weighted and value-weighted returns of the portfolios.

3. **Post-ranking betas** <br> Estimate the market beta of each portfolio by regressing daily *excess portfolio return* on *excess market return* using entire sample period.
<br>
The regressor variable (market return) is constructed by the contemporaneous excess market return and five lags of the contemporaneous excess market returns to account for the illiquidity of small stocks.
<br>
Post-ranking beta is the sum of six ordinary least squares (OLS) coefficients.

4. **result** <br>`X-axis` represents twenty (20) beta-sorted portfolios from *the lowest beta portfolio* (left) to *the highest beta portfolio* (right).
<br>
`Y-axis` represents equal-weighted and value-weighted portfolio return, in left subplot and right subplot respectively.

### Measuring investors' disagreement
Here I use stock analyst forecast of the earnings per share (EPS) long-term growth rate (LTG) as the main proxy for investors’ opinion about the individual stocks.
